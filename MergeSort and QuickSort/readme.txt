README FILE

This file is for both Merge Sort and Quick Sort.

---- Both the programs are executed on Eclipse IDE.
----To run the program in differnt system, we have to remove my import package of class as I have implemented in my Java Project.
---- For generating the random numbers, I have written a function and have commented it for your reference. 
---- By uncommenting the "Generate random number" function and commenting the other part of the main() function of code, the array of sorted integers will be generated for 1000,1500,2000 intergers by giving these values in the function.
---- To run the code in terminal, compile the code by using the command "javac filename.java". To execute it use the command "java filename"
----It will then ask for the user's input for the size of the array and the array elements and the result will be in sorted array.
